## Development

1. Get [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

    ```sh
    npm i -g yarn@latest
    ```

    **Why Yarn?** We use [selective resolution
    overrides](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/)
    to work around React version discrepancies in several of our dependencies.

1. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

1. Run the development server:

    ```sh
    yarn start
    # npm works, too!
    npm start
    ```
