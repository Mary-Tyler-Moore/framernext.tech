This Next.js static site is a technical showcase of the Framer X API Examples implemented within a production React Application environment. Each thumbnail links to a CodeSandbox which hosts the <a href="https://www.framer.com/api/examples">Framer API example</a> built within <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a>.
</p>

<p>Each Framer X API example links to the documentation and original Framer Codesandbox to compare and contrast.</p>

## Disclaimers!

- Putting the Framer X API into a production React application is definitely more of a could than a should! This is mainly a technical exercise!, but also a celebration of the technologies and communities which have enabled me to have a career flourishing as a Software Engineer 👩🏻‍💻

- To make the examples work, it was necessary to rewrite some of Framer's the custom React Hooks (with particular reference to useCycle).

- Scrolling example does not fully work (fails silently)

- The Transforms API example sadly did not translate.
